K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and effective algorithm used for cancer diagnosis.

By training with a dataset representing clinical features, it predicts whether new individuals have cancer or not. 

KNN makes predictions by taking a majority vote of the classes of its nearest neighbors.

It is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, contributing to medical decision-making processes.
